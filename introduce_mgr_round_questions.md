### Q. Tell me about yourself ? ( asked to guage the presentation skills of the person )

Hi, I’m Anush Varada, and I have over 17 years of experience in Network Protocol Testing, Automation, and Cloud/Virtualization technologies.

I currently work as a Technical Lead at Keysight Technologies, where I lead automation initiatives for L4–L7 network security and cloud products. 

My core strengths include Python automation, REST API-based framework development, and network security feature testing using tools like IxLoad, IxNetwork, Breaking Point, and CyPerf. I also have extensive hands-on experience with cloud deployments on AWS, Azure, and GCP, as well as virtualization on ESXi and KVM.


I work on Automation for L4/L7 Ixia products Along with the internal testing I also develope and provide optimized scalable Python-based automation solutions / APIs and tools which we help to integrate with the CI/CD pipelines or Automation frameworks for major clients like Cisco, Juniper, Palo Alto Networks, Broadcom, NVDIA and Nokia.

Apart from Automation , I have expertise with Cloud domain so I also contribute towards Proof-of-Concepts (POCs) for enterprise and data center customers, focusing on SASE, Virtual Firewall, and Load Balancer validation, and have delivered corporate trainings on automation with Ixia and virtualization to global clients.

In addition to my technical expertise, I actively contribute to framework design, team mentorship, and process optimization, ensuring efficient testing and faster product validation cycles.

Overall, I bring a blend of deep technical knowledge, hands-on Cloud experience, and leadership skills, and I’m passionate about building automation solutions that drive reliability and scalability in complex networking environments.

### Q. When asked about anything you dont know 

- on tools and automation 
While I may not have worked extensively with all of these tools, 
I have hands-on experience in automated testing concepts, designing test scripts, and integrating automation into CI/CD pipelines, and I’m confident in quickly getting up to speed with these frameworks if required.”

- on kubernetes
While I may not have worked extensively with kubernetes and microservices , I have good hands-on experience in Cloud platforms ( AWS , Azure , GCP ) and I am confident I can quickly get up to speed on kubernetes.

### Q. What are you looking for in this role ? ( asked to see if candidate is a good fit )

F5

I went through the job description and felt that it aligns very well with my areas of expertise — particularly in Automation, Cloud, and Performance Testing. These are domains I’ve worked extensively in, and I’m confident I can add value to the project using the knowledge and experience I’ve built over the years.

At the same time, I’m always eager to learn and explore new technologies or approaches that come up as part of the work. So, I see this role as a great opportunity to both contribute effectively and continue growing professionally


### Q. How would you learn and get ready for the role ? ( asked to see the mindset of the candidate )


To get ready for the role, I would start by understanding the project’s objectives, 
the tools and frameworks being used, 
and the team’s current processes. 

I’d spend time reviewing any available documentation, setup guides, internal resources, official documentation and code repositories to get hands-on familiarity as quickly as possible.

I believe the best way to learn is by doing, so I’d also collaborate closely with team members to understand ongoing work and start contributing in smaller areas first, gradually taking on larger responsibilities as I get more context.

  
### Q. Why are you leaving the current role ? 

I had moved to the U.S. a couple of months ago for a project requirement. However, for personal reasons, I need to relocate back to Bangalore. Because of this, I’ve started exploring opportunities here that align with my experience and areas of expertise.

It’s a planned move, and it won’t impact my availability or work focus.

Follow UP Q: If the interviewer asks a follow-up (e.g., ‘Couldn’t you move back within your current company?’):

As per the company’s HR policy, once you move onsite, an internal transfer back to India isn’t possible for at least 1 to 1.5 years. Given my current situation, waiting that long wasn’t feasible, so I decided to look for external opportunities in Bangalore.


### Q. How will you contribute to our team ? ( to see how you fit into current role )

- I see it as my responsibility to fit into your team , to be flexible and to do all I can 
  to add value to what they are already achieving.
  
  I would use the technical knowledge and experience I have gained till now to shape and support the current project and contribute towards its success.
  
### Q. How do you prioritize tasks at work ? ( to assess how organized you are )

I see it as my responsibility to integrate well with the team, stay flexible, and contribute in a way that adds real value to the work already being done. I would leverage the technical knowledge and experience I’ve gained so far to support and enhance the current project’s goals, while also collaborating closely with team members to ensure collective success.

I believe in contributing not just through my individual work, but also by sharing ideas, helping others when needed, and maintaining a positive, solution-oriented approach.

### Q. What are your strengths and weakness ?

### Strengths 

- I learn things quickly and require very little or no supervission, as I can be relied upon
  to do everything to the right standard and on time.

- I am a good problem solver , understand the problem , learn what is needed quickly and try to solve the problem.

- I am somebody that always takes responsibility for my own professional development and I embrace change positively

### Weakness

- My weakness lies in drawing a line between work and personal time, and creating work life balance
  but I am trying to work on it and be more mindful.
  
### Q. How would you react if a project you are working half way through had to be restarted - question to assess how irritable you get

- Whatever the buisness needs me to do , I will do it.
  I would definetely ask and sync up with my manager on what needs to be done differently this time
  but I would apply same level of professionalism and dedication once I start the project again.
  
### Q. What's your ideal work environment ? ( asked to assess how you are in the team )

- I prefer to work in a diverse work environment where there is a variety of skill and experience 
  brought because this means you can learn from every other team member.
  
- It is important to me to work in a progressive work environment where everyone is innovating , creating , 
  problem solving and supporting their work collegues to achieve the buisness goals.
  
### Q. How to you react to the mistakes you make ? ( to assess your personality )

- Taking ownership of the mistake is important, because that enables you and others to learn from the mistakes.
  and also allows to put things right and to quickly move on.
  
- I would not dwell on the mistakes , but I'd be honest and inform the manager if necessary.

- I would also assess why I had made the mistake so I could improve for next time.

### Q. How do you handle conflicts with co workers ?  ( you will be assessed how you would handle and not just inform manager )

- 1st of all where possible I would try to avoid conflict as it does not benefit anyone.

if unavoidable then , 

- Stay calm and professional 
- listen actively and understand the difference in perspective 
- communicate clearly and express my perspective
- find a common ground , both the team members intention is the project to succeed , so I would encourage to discuss combine ideas to achieve the best outcome.
- Seek a solution and not blame , I would focus on finding a solution rather than blaming.

### Q. Do you have any questions 

What are the most critical challenges for someone stepping into this role in the first 6–12 months?
Could you share a bit about the current technology stack or tools being used in this project?
Are there opportunities to contribute beyond project delivery — like process improvements, mentoring, or innovation initiatives?
Are there opportunities to drive initiatives beyond day-to-day project work, such as R&D, automation, or innovation?
